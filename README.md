Hi, I’m Onyeka Ubah—a certified full stack web developer with a passion for designing and building user-centric web applications. My technical toolkit includes Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I am constantly expanding my skill set to keep up with the latest industry trends.

I believe that technology should be both functional and inspiring, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to blend logic with creativity. Whether it’s developing robust APIs, creating responsive UIs, or optimizing database performance, I’m committed to delivering high-quality solutions.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me dancing. For me, dance is not only a fun way to exercise but also a source of inspiration and energy. I bring that same enthusiasm and rhythm to my work in tech.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, connect with me on LinkedIn, or reach out to collaborate!
